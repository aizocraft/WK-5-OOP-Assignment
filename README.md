# OOPClass & Polymorphism Assignment

## Overview

This project demonstrates the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using Python. It includes two assignments that explore classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

### 1. **Class**  
Create classes for a **Superhero** and a **Villain**. The **Superhero** class includes attributes like name, power, and city, while the **Villain** class inherits from **Superhero** and overrides certain methods. This assignment demonstrates key OOP principles like **Encapsulation** and **Inheritance**.

### 2. **Polymorphism Challenge**  
This challenge demonstrates **Polymorphism** by creating classes for various **Vehicles** (Car, Plane, Boat) and **Animals** (Dog, Fish, Bird). Each class implements a `move()` method, and the objects respond differently based on their class, highlighting polymorphic behavior.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Classes & Objects**: Modeling real-world entities like superheroes, villains, vehicles, and animals.
- **Encapsulation**: Hiding internal details using private attributes and methods.
- **Inheritance**: Extending classes to inherit behavior and attributes from other classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Defining a common method across different classes with customized behavior.
